# Gitrs

A Rewrite of Git in Rust.

This is purely for my educational purposes, to learn more about git and practice writing Rust.

There is no guarantee that this software will build or work at any point. **Clone/Fork at your own risk.**

Currently using Rust version 1.50.0 stable, and currently only targeting my daily driver: *Pop!_OS/Ubuntu*. I'm not currently concerned about cross-platform support, but it could be a priority in the future.
