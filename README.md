# Gitrs

A Rewrite of Git in Rust.

This is purely for my educational purposes, to learn more about git and practice writing Rust. This is not meant as a full fledge replacement of Git.

There is no guarantee that this software will build or work at this, I'm currently in the beginning, experimental and reaserach phase of this project. **Clone/Fork at your own risk.**

Currently using Rust version 1.50.0 stable, and only targeting my daily driver for now: *Pop!_OS/Ubuntu*. I'm not too concerned about cross-platform support at this time, but it become a priority in the future.

Wish my luck, and feel free to submit a PR!
