# Gitrs

A Rewrite of Git in Rust.

This is purely for my educational purposes, to learn more about git and practice writing Rust. This is not meant as a full fledge replacement of Git.

There is no guarantee that this software will build or work at any point. **Clone/Fork at your own risk.**

Currently using Rust version 1.50.0 stable, and only targeting my daily driver: *Pop!_OS/Ubuntu*. I'm not concerned about cross-platform support for now, but it could be a priority in the future.
