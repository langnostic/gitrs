# Gitrs

A Rewrite of Git in Rust.

## Purpose

This is purely for my educational purposes, to learn more about git and practice writing a "real" project with Rust. This is not meant as a full fledge replacement of Git, and I do not recommend anyone actually using this software, at this time.

## Warning

There is no guarantee that this repo will build or work, at the moment. I'm currently in the beginning, experimental, and reaserach phase of this project. Things will change and break at any time, as I learn more about both git and Rust. **Clone/Fork at your own risk.**

## Rust Version and Targets

Currently using Rust version 1.52.1 stable, and only targeting my daily driver for now: *Pop!_OS/Ubuntu 20.10*. I'm not concerned about cross-platform support right now, and I make no guarantees that this will work on any other platform.

Wish my luck, and feel free to submit a PR!
